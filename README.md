# Hamming Code Error Detection

Aims at building a Hamming Code Error Detection Circuit which detects errors during data transmission. Hamming code is a set of error-correction codes that can be used to detect and correct the errors that can occur when the data is moved or stored from the sender to the receiver. It is technique developed by R.W. Hamming for error correction. 
## Goals
